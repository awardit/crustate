## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Added missing second `sourceName` parameter to `useSendMessage` closure.
- Added `removeNested` to `Storage` and `StateInstance`.
- React `StateProvider` will now call `removeNested` if it is the last provider
  to listen to the state `stateNewData` event.

## Changed
- The `stateNewData` event on `StateInstance` will now use `T` as the type
  for the state-data.

## [0.0.4] - 2019-05-14
### Fixed
- Added `replyMessage` to list of public symbols for build-script.

## [0.0.3] - 2019-05-14
### Added
- Added `State`.`replyMessage` to allow outside code to send messages to
  state-instances.

## [0.0.2] - 2019-05-10
### Added
- Added license file, MIT, same as `package.json` already specifies.
- Added `messageMatched` events when subscribers on `Storage` match messages.
- Added an optional parameter of `sourceName` to `sendMessage` which is appended
  to the source-path, this parameter defaults to the anonymous source "`$`".
- Added TodoMVC Example

### Changed
- Changed all events which had a `StateInstance` as the last parameter now no
  longer have that parameter.
- `State` type-signature has been modified to also carry the `Message` type,
  this also propagates to `StateInstance`, `StateUpdate`, `Storage`,
  `StateData` and `useData`.

### Fixed
- Messages queued by an instance creation are no longer processed by the same
  instance, this prevents any logic loops from forming.

## [0.0.1] - 2019-04-10
### Added
